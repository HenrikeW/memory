## Memory Game

The classical game "memory" in an online one-player version. There's a plant theme behind the images. Be proud if you can identify all the species! ðŸŒ¿

# What it does

12 pairs of cards are hidden. The goal of the game is to find all the matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time. As soon as you have found a matching pair, the two cards disappear from the game board. If the two cards you flipped are not a match, they will flip back automatically after 1,5 seconds and you can try again. 
If you click the "Reset"-button, all cards are in the game again, shuffled and a new game starts.

As soon as you have finished a game (i.e. found all 12 matching pairs), you'll get to know how many turns you needed. Try to get better each time! ðŸ¥‡

# The approach

I wanted to build the game as simply as possible and only used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I mainly followed this tutorial:

I didn't copy all the clicking animations though. Also, I added the buttons to reset and play again, a turn counter and a little rewarding winner image if you manage to solve the game.
